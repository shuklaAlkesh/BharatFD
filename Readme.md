# Django FAQ Management System

## Overview
This project, the **Django FAQ Management System**, is designed to efficiently manage and display FAQs in a multi-language format. It uses advanced techniques such as caching, rich-text formatting, and automated translations, which allow for a seamless and scalable FAQ management experience. The system also includes a REST API for programmatically accessing the FAQs in various languages.

## Problem Statement
- **Challenge**: Managing FAQs with support for multiple languages, while ensuring scalability, performance, and ease of use.
- **Core Requirements**:
  - Efficiently store FAQs with questions and answers.
  - Provide multi-language support for FAQs.
  - Display answers using a rich-text format to allow rich formatting like bold, italic, images, etc.
  - Optimize performance with caching, specifically for translated FAQs, and allow for automatic translation.
  - Offer a simple, intuitive interface for managing FAQs.

## Approach & Solution

### 1. **Storing FAQs & Translations**:
   - The FAQ system stores both questions and answers in a database, with the ability to add multiple translations for each language.
   - The FAQ content is stored in the Django model with fields for `question`, `answer`, and `language`.
   - Translations are automatically fetched using the **Google Translate API** for different languages. This reduces the manual effort in translating content and increases productivity.

### 2. **Rich Text Formatting**:
   - Answers are formatted using the **django-ckeditor** editor, which allows the use of rich text features such as bold, italics, images, and links, ensuring that answers are presented in a clear, organized manner.
   - The editor is easy to use, and content can be styled without requiring knowledge of HTML.

### 3. **Caching with Redis**:
   - To improve performance, translations of FAQs are cached using **Redis**. This ensures that repeated translation requests for the same FAQ are faster, minimizing API calls to the Google Translate API.
   - Redis is used as an in-memory data store to cache the translation responses, which significantly reduces latency and optimizes response times.

### 4. **Django Admin Interface**:
   - The project includes the Django admin interface, which allows administrators to add, update, and manage FAQ questions and answers with ease. Admins can also update language translations for each FAQ entry directly from the admin panel.

### 5. **REST API for Multi-language Support**:
   - The system provides a simple and flexible REST API to fetch FAQs in multiple languages. By specifying the `lang` query parameter, users can get FAQs in different languages (e.g., English, Hindi, Bengali).
   - The API supports dynamic queries and provides a straightforward way to interact with FAQ data.

### 6. **Docker Support**:
   - To facilitate easy deployment, Docker support is included. The project provides a **Dockerfile** and **docker-compose.yml** configuration to easily containerize the Django application.
   - This ensures that the application can be run consistently across different environments (development, production, etc.) without worrying about dependency issues.

## Key Features
- **Multilingual FAQ Management**: Easily manage and display FAQs in multiple languages (e.g., English, Hindi, Bengali).
- **Rich Text Formatting**: Answer content is displayed using the **django-ckeditor** editor for easy formatting.
- **Caching for Performance**: Translations are cached using **Redis** to improve speed.
- **Automatic Translations**: FAQs are automatically translated using the **Google Translate API**.
